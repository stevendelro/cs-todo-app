# DO IT.

- Proof of concept. 
- The front end has many of the core functionalities I intended to produce, but refactoring to implement a legitimate backend would become more work than rebuilding from scratch.

Some goals completed:

## COMPLETED

  - [x] get the date to space-between in the task summary. something to do with: class="MuiAccordionSummary-content"
  - [x] "finished" button should toggle indv. todo completion status.
  - [x] "delete" button should remove todo from todo list.
  - [x] install and utilize material ui react
  - [x] change all instances of "todo" to task, along with appropriate filename changes.
  - [x] seperate tasklist and form.
  - [x] "edit" button functionality
    - prevent the input from CreateTaskForm from displaying change in taskItemState
    - change the button group to have different options on edit
    - the task title should change with each key press
    - updated details will be revealed onSubmit.
  - [x] create a way to set the priority of each task:
    - low
    - high
    - urgent
  - [x] must be able to edit priority in edit mode.
  - [x] add cancel option in edit mode
  - [x] migrate to nextjs (branched)
  - [x] completely redesign AccordianSummary to work with chips
